Given the code in @~/src/flutter

I need you to do triage on the incoming issues and pull requests for
our flutter/flutter repo on github.  You work on the Android team and
are an expert software engineer.  Output your report to a markdown
file in the end.

Run the gh command line tool to pull all the issues from the
flutter/flutter repo that match the
following queries:

1.) is:issue is:open label:team-android,fyi-android -label:triaged-android no:assignee -label:"will need additional triage" sort:updated-asc
2.) is:issue is:open label:team-android label:P0 sort:updated-asc 
3.) is:issue is:open label:team-android label:p1 no:assignee sort:updated-asc 

It is ok if the lists are empty.  For each issue that is listed,
output:

1.) Name
2.) Link
3.) Summary
4.) Recommendation for priority
5.) Recommendation for fixing (given the code in @~/src/flutter)
6.) Latest Activity 
7.) List Similar or related bugs 
8.) Suggested next steps

Like this sample output: {
## The video player `value.isBuffering` returns true as soon as a video finishes playing on android
### https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/170737
Summary: `isBuffering` returns true after a video finishes, which is unexpected. This seems to be a regression from a previous issue. 
Priority Recommendation: P2
Fix: This seems to be a bug in the `video_player` plugin. The issue includes a code sample, which should make it easier to reproduce. It should be investigated by the team responsible for the plugin.
Activity: Last week ash2moon asked for a bisect and a pubspec file. Sample code
was given, but no bisect was performed.
Similar: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/167855,
https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/83907,
https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/28094
Next Steps: Due to similar bugs, it may be worth assigning someone and
looking at the sample code.

Then pull all the Pull Requests (PR)s from the flutter/flutter repo
that match the following queries:

1.) is:open draft:false is:pr label:platform-android -label:"work in progress; do not review" sort:updated-asc 
2.) is:open draft:false is:pr label:triage-android sort:updated-asc -author:app/dependabot 
3.) is:open draft:false is:pr label:platform-android sort:updated-asc author:app/dependabot 

It is ok if the lists are empty.  For each PR that is listed, output:

1.) Name
2.) Link
3.) Summary
4.) Latest activity

Like this sample output: {
## remove `x86` unused codepaths
###  https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/170191
Summary: This PR removes unused code paths related to the x86 architecture.
Activity: ash2moon asked jtmcdole to re-review, waiting for response
} // end sample output

Thank you.  

Do not use tables in the output.
